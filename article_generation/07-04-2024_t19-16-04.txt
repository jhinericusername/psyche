Content: b'Meanwhile, states like Colorado, New Mexico and Virginia have moved noticeably towards the Democrats, and the party has become the dominant political force there.[29][30][31]\nThe Democratic electoral coalition, securing the "blue states" for Democratic presidential candidates, performs best among Jewish and Black voters;[32][33] whites who are wealthy or postgraduates,[34] or live in urban areas.[35] Working class voters were also a mainstay of the Democratic coalition since the days of the New Deal, but since the 1970s, many have defected to Republicans as the Democratic Party moved significantly to the left on cultural issues.[36] Conversely, the traditional Republican coalition that dominates many "red states" is mainly composed of rural white voters, evangelicals, the elderly, and non-college educated voters.[37]\nRepublicans have also historically performed well with suburban, middle class voters since the 1950s, but this bloc has drifted away from them in recent years due to the rise of the Tea Party movement and later the Make America Great Again movement.[38] Biden\'s support for Israel has greatly damaged Muslim support for Democrats in polling.[80] Polling has indicated a significant divide between elite opinion of the Israel\xe2\x80\x93Hamas war, which has overwhelmingly taken the side of Israel, and the general public.[81] A plurality of Americans oppose American military aid to Israel and believe that the United States "should be a neutral mediator" in the Israel-Palestinian conflict rather than taking a side.[81] Among voters 18-34, 66 percent disapprove of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the war and 20 percent approve, while a majority take the side of Palestinians predominately in the conflict.[82]\nHealthcare issues\nThe issue of healthcare and drug policy, including whether the United States should shift to a universal healthcare system,[83] and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election.[84]\n If Trump is elected, he would become the second president to win a second non-consecutive term, joining Grover Cleveland who did so in 1892.[15]\nElection interference\nDonald Trump did not concede to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, and has continued denying the election results as of 2023[update].[16][17] Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process or refuse to certify the 2024 election results.[18]\nPolling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy.[19][20][21] Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[22] Many Republicans are concerned with attempts to prevent former President Trump from holding public office by any means necessary, including impeachment and indictment.[23]\nElectoral map\n Supporters of the laws claim that conversations about racial identity are not appropriate for a school environment.[66][67][10] Critics of the laws against critical race theory claim they whitewash American history and act as memory laws to rewrite public memory of U.S. history.[68]\nForeign policy\nThe Israel\xe2\x80\x93Hamas war and Russian invasion of Ukraine are expected to be significant issues of the campaign.[69]\nThe United States has provided significant military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[70][71][72] Democratic politicians and a significant number of Republican politicians have supported this plan, arguing that the United States has a significant role to play in "protecting democracy and fighting Russian aggression. This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census.[24][25] If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same (which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections) in 2024, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans\' 235, a slight change from Biden\'s 306 electoral votes and Trump\'s 232, meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process.'
